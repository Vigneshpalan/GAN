# Fashion GAN

This repository contains code for training a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate images of fashion items using the Fashion MNIST dataset.

## Introduction

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of artificial intelligence algorithms used in unsupervised machine learning. They consist of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, which are trained simultaneously through adversarial training. In this project, we implement a GAN to generate images of fashion items such as clothing and accessories.

## Dataset

We use the Fashion MNIST dataset, which is a collection of 28x28 grayscale images of fashion items belonging to 10 different categories. The dataset is preprocessed and loaded using TensorFlow Datasets.

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, you'll need the following dependencies:

- TensorFlow
- TensorFlow Datasets
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
